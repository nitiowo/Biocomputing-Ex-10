#2 Write a game called “guess my number”. The computer will generate a random number between 1 and 100. 
#The user types in a number and the computer replies “lower” if the random number is lower than the guess, “higher” if the random number is higher, and “correct!” if the guess is correct. 
#The player can continue guessing up to 10 times.

# create function to play the "guess my number" game
guess_my_number <- function() {
  # use sample to generate a random number in the game
  randomnumber <- sample(1:100, 1)
  attempts <- 0 #create a variable that stores the number of attempts in the game
  
  print("Welcome to guess my number") #print a welcome statement for the start of the game
  print("The answer is a number between 1 and 100.") #print rules for the game
  print("You have a total of 10 attempts to guess the correct number.")
  
  for (attempts in 1:10) { #create a for loop to enter your guess 
    guess <- as.integer(readline("Enter your guess: "))
    
    if (guess < randomnumber) { #tells you after each guess whether the guess was too high or too low or the correct number
      print("Higher! Try again.")
    } else if (guess > randomnumber) {
      print("Lower! Try again.")
